my journey to learn java from scratch
As java is the base for most of the applications today, i started learning it from scratch.
the very first thing that you one has to do , is to make the sytem compatible for java programs and for that a java development environment should be there.
to check whether the system has java environment or not just simply type java -version in command propmt.
if it is not there a message of java is not recognised will appear.
now to start jdk in our system will must follow some steps.
i took reference from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uadGsNA6h5Q.
